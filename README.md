# 🧠Brain Tumor Distribution Analysis
## 📑Project Overview

This project analyzes brain tumor patients data to explore patterns in tumor distribution, patient demographics, and treatment types. Using the datasets provided in the guided tutorial by Isaac Emmanuel, a dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and trends interactively. The purpose of this project is to gain insights into brain tumor characteristics and patient demographics, while practicing data analysis, visualization, and dashboard design in Power BI.The date of diagnosis in the dataset ranges from 2015 to 2025.

## 🗃️Dataset
The analysis uses two main datasets:
1. **brain_tumor_data**
     - Columns:
     -   Patient ID🆔
     -   Age
     -   Gender
     -   Tumor Type
     -   Tumor Grade
     -   Affected Brain Region
     -   Tumor Size
     -   Symptoms
     -   Laterality
     -   Histology Confirmation
     -   Treatment Type
     -   Date of Diagnosis
     -   Age Group
  2.  tumor_grade_data
     - Columns
      - Tumor Grade
      - Image URL
      - Icon URL

Minimal data cleaning was required. Measures and formulas were created for:
- Averagge intake per year
- Age group
- Most affected age group

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, measures creation, and interactive dashboard development  
- **Power Query** – Data transformation and preparation  
- **Power Point** - Dahboard background layout
- YouTube - Tutorial from analyst isaac emmanuel

  ## 📊Dashboard Overview
  The dashboard was built in power BI and featuures:
  ### Metrics
  - Total Patients
  - Average age
  - Average tumor size
  ### Visuals
  - Tumor distribution by size
  - Top affected brain region
  - Most affected age group
  - Annual patients diagnosed
  ### Interactive features
  - Butons and chiclet slicers to filter data
  - Images and icons controlled dynamically by slicers
  ### Design
  - Visual positioned for clarity
  - Consistent formatting and color scheme matching the background

  ## 💡Key Insights

  ### Grade I Tumors
  - Grade I tumors recorded approximately 2.4k total patients, with an average age of 51.1years
  - Meningioma had the highest percentage in tumor size distribution
  - The pituituary gland was identified as the most affected brain region
  - 2016 had the highest number of diagnosed patients for this grade
  - Patients aged 41–50 represented the most affected age group.

   ### Grade II Tumors
   - Grade II tumors accounted for 680 total patients, with an average age of 42.35 years.
  - Ependymoma was the most prevalent tumor type in this grade.
   - The brainstem emerged as the most affected brain region.
   - The highest number of diagnoses occurred in 2020.
   - The 41–50 age group was the most affected.

   ### Grade III Tumors
- Grade III tumors included 698 total patients, with an average age of 37.52 years.
- Ependymoma remained the dominant tumor type.
- The cerebellum was the most affected brain region.
- 2016 recorded the highest annual patient diagnoses.
- Patients aged 21–40 were the most affected age group.

  ### Grade IV Tumors
- Grade IV tumors recorded the highest patient volume, with approximately 3.6k total patients and an average age of 40.45 years.
- Glioma had the highest percentage in tumor type distribution.
- The cerebellum was the most affected brain region.
- The peak year for diagnoses was 2016.
- Patients aged 60+ were the most affected age group.

## 📅 Diagnosis Timeline
Overall, patient diagnoses in the dataset span from 2015 to 2025, providing a decade-long view of brain tumor trends across all grades.
